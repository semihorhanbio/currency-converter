# About

The Currency Converter is a simple console program that calculates the amount of money you get by converting one currency to another. I will apply many concepts of Python — basic types, variables, arithmetic operations, loops, and working with files during this project. Get a taste of more advanced features — JSON format, caching, and how to work with the network. I will write a currency converter program that uses a third-party service.
